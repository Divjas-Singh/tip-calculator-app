### Useful resources

- [https://neumorphism.io/](https://neumorphism.io/) - This helped me in creating neat and aesthetic buttons easily.
- [https://regexr.com/](https://regexr.com/) - This is an amazing site which helped me finally understanding and implementing Regular Expressions for form validation. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
